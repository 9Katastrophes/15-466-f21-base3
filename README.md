# Who Killed Mr.Alpha

Author: Katherine Wang

Design: What's interesting about my game is you need to listen carefully to audio recordings to determine who murdered Mr.Alpha.

How To Play:

Use WASD to move your investigator around. Talk to the suspects and listen to their alibis. Listen carefully to the audio recording evidence. Determine who the real murderer is and arrest them with SPACE.
